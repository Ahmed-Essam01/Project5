# 🌲 Forest Cover Type Classification

## 📘 Overview
This project predicts the forest cover type (such as spruce, aspen, pine, etc.) based on cartographic and environmental variables like soil type, elevation, and slope.  
It helps in ecological mapping and environmental monitoring.

## 🧠 Project Steps
- Load and preprocess the Covertype dataset (UCI)
- Handle categorical and numerical features
- Train multi-class classification models using Scikit-learn and XGBoost
- Evaluate model performance using confusion matrix and accuracy metrics
- Visualize feature importance and model results

## 🧩 Tools & Libraries
`Python` · `Pandas` · `Scikit-learn` · `XGBoost` · `Matplotlib`

## 📊 Covered Topics
Multi-class Classification | Tree-based Modeling | Feature Importance
